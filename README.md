# tool-db-master
flask-app. credit goes to thomas mulrooney for this original codebase. I have ported this to run in docker with gunicorn.

notes:  

master branch - dockerized version launched with gunicorn for production. tested working on AWS.

repl.it branch - the key is added to secrets of the repl.it instance. code is changed to call this new location.
